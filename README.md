# Spotify-Artist-Analyzer

The objective of this project was to build a flexible, exploratory tool for users to explore any musical artists within the Spotify database. In addition the tool allows for user input to determine the specific artists to analyze. The analysis focuses on a few general aspects of each artist (albums, followers, popularity, etc...), and then dives into the specific type of music the artist produces. To determine the specifics, each artist's Top 10 tracks and the associated track features (listed below) are collected and then aggreagated for visual analysis.
